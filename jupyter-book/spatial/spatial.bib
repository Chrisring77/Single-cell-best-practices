This has led to an explosion of interest in computational methods and techniques for harnessing both spatial and transcriptional information in analysis of ST datasets. The wide diversity of approaches in aim, methodology and technology for ST provides great challenges in dissecting cellular functions in spatial contexts.

abstract = {Background & Aims
Molecular evidence of cellular heterogeneity in the human exocrine pancreas has not been yet established because of the local concentration and cascade of hydrolytic enzymes that can rapidly degrade cells and RNA upon pancreatic resection. We sought to better understand the heterogeneity and cellular composition of the pancreas in neonates and adults in healthy and diseased conditions using single-cell sequencing approaches.
Methods
We innovated single-nucleus RNA-sequencing protocols and profiled more than 120,000 cells from pancreata of adult and neonatal human donors. We validated the single-nucleus findings using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, in situ sequencing, and computational approaches.
Results
We created the first comprehensive atlas of human pancreas cells including epithelial and nonepithelial constituents, and uncovered 3 distinct acinar cell types, with possible implications for homeostatic and inflammatory processes of the pancreas. The comparison with neonatal single-nucleus sequencing data showed a different cellular composition of the endocrine tissue, highlighting the tissue dynamics occurring during development. By applying spatial cartography, involving cell proximity mapping through in situ sequencing, we found evidence of specific cell type neighborhoods, dynamic topographies in the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, and principles of morphologic organization of the organ. Furthermore, similar analyses in chronic pancreatitis biopsy samples showed the presence of acinar-REG+ cells, a reciprocal association between macrophages and activated stellate cells, and a new potential role of tuft cells in this disease.
Conclusions
Our human pancreas cell atlas can be interrogated to understand pancreatic cell biology and provides a crucial reference set for comparisons with diseased tissue samples to map the cellular foundations of pancreatic diseases.}

  abstract  = "If you are a biologist and want to get the best out of the
               powerful methods of modern computational statistics, this is
               your book. You can visualize and analyze your own data, apply
               unsupervised and supervised learning, integrate datasets, apply
               hypothesis testing, and make publication-quality figures using
               the power of R/Bioconductor and ggplot2. This book will teach
               you 'cooking from scratch', from raw data to beautiful
               illuminating output, as you learn to write your own scripts in
               the R language and to use advanced statistics packages from CRAN
               and Bioconductor. It covers a broad range of basic and advanced
               topics important in the analysis of high-throughput biological
               data, including principal component analysis and
               multidimensional scaling, clustering, multiple testing,
               unsupervised and supervised learning, resampling, the pitfalls
               of experimental design, and power simulations using Monte Carlo,
               and it even reaches networks, trees, spatial statistics, image
               data, and microbial ecology. Using a minimum of mathematical
               notation, it builds understanding from well-chosen examples,

Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can profile cells comprehensively, but lose spatial information. Spatial transcriptomics allows for spatial measurements, but at lower resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput. To overcome these limitations we present Tangram, a method that aligns sc/snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same region, including MERFISH, STARmap, smFISH, Spatial Transcriptomics (Visium) and histological images. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multimodal data such as those from SHARE-seq, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate Tangram on healthy mouse brain tissue, by reconstructing a genome-wide anatomically integrated spatial map at single-cell resolution of the visual and somatomotor areas.},

Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets.

To resolve this discrepancy, we developed SpaGE, a method that integrates spatial and scRNA-seq datasets to predict whole-transcriptome expressions in their spatial configuration.

We find that specific pairs of fetal liver cell types are preferentially positioned next to each other. Ligand-receptor signaling molecule pairs such as Kitl and Kit are enriched in neighboring cell types. The majority of HSCs are in direct contact with endothelial cells (ECs) in both WT and Tet2−/− fetal livers. Loss of Tet2 increases the number of HSCs, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling genes in the HSC niche. Two subtypes of ECs, arterial ECs and sinusoidal ECs, and other cell types contribute distinct signaling molecules to the HSC niche.

Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease.},

Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data.

SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots). Simulating varying reference quantities and qualities, we confirmed high prediction accuracy also with shallowly sequenced or small-sized scRNA-seq reference datasets. SPOTlight deconvolution of the mouse brain correctly mapped subtle neuronal cell states of the cortical layers and the defined architecture of the hippocampus. In human pancreatic cancer, we successfully segmented patient sections and further fine-mapped normal and neoplastic cell states.

Current methods designed for similar purposes tend to be built around a framework of statistical hypothesis testing, hence we were compelled to explore a fundamentally different strategy.We propose an unexplored approach to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, simulating diffusion of individual transcripts to extract genes with spatial patterns. The method performed as expected when presented with synthetic data. When applied to real data, it identified genes with distinct spatial profiles, involved in key biological processes or characteristic for certain cell types. Compared to existing methods, ours seemed to be less informed by the genes’ expression levels and showed better time performance when run with multiple cores.Open-source Python package with a command line interface (CLI), freely available at https://github.com/almaan/sepal under an MIT licence.

    abstract = {Single-cell gene expression data with positional information is critical to dissect mechanisms and architectures of multicellular organisms, but the potential is limited by the scalability of current data analysis strategies. Here, we present scGCO, a method based on fast optimization of hidden Markov Random Fields with graph cuts to identify spatially variable genes. Comparing to existing methods, scGCO delivers a superior performance with lower false positive rate and improved specificity, while demonstrates a more robust performance in the presence of noises. Critically, scGCO scales near linearly with inputs and demonstrates orders of magnitude better running time and memory requirement than existing methods, and could represent a valuable solution when spatial transcriptomics data grows into millions of data points and beyond.},

    "After annotating cell types or cell states in the dataset (or spots, according to the technology at end), we can quantify whether such annotations are spatially enriched. \n",
    "To this end, Computing a neighborhood enrichment can help us identify clusters that are neighbors in the tissue of interest. \n",
    "In short, it’s an enrichment score on spatial proximity of clusters: if observations (cells or spots) belonging to a cluster are often close to observations belonging to \n",
    "another cluster, then they will have a high score and will appear to be enriched. On the other hand, if they are far apart, and therefore are seldom neighbors, the score will be low and they can be defined as depleted.\n",
    "This score is based on a permutation-based test, and you can set the number of permutations with the n_perms argument (default is 1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the function works on a spatial connectivity matrix (spatial graph), we need to compute that as well. This can be done with `squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll directly visualize the results with `squidpy.pl.nhood_enrichment()`.\n"

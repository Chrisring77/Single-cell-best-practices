    "Single-cell datasets allow studying biological processes such as early development at a high resolution. While single cells are analysed instead of a tissue as a whole, for example, changes in cells' phenotypic trades cannot be tracked over time. This fact stems from the destructive nature of single-cell sequencing protocols. Upon sequencing a cell, it is destroyed and its defining characteristics can, thus, not be measured again at a later time point. Notably, experimental techniques not only fail measuring the general cellular profile at different times but also how quickly these changes take place. Recovering the position in time along the developmental landscape can be achieved with tools from the field of *trajectory inference* (TI). However, classical TI methods do not offer any directed, dynamic information. Additionally, these algorithms traditionally do not take into account information beyond transcriptomic reads and similarity."

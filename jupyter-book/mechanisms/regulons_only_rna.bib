  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the regulation of gene
              expression has benefited from the availability of high-throughput
              technologies that interrogate the whole genome for the binding of
              specific transcription factors and gene expression profiles. In
              the case of widely used model organisms, such as Escherichia coli
              K-12, the new knowledge gained from these approaches needs to be
              integrated with the legacy of accumulated knowledge from genetic
              and molecular biology experiments conducted in the pre-genomic
              era in order to attain the deepest level of understanding
              possible based on the available data. RESULTS: In this paper, we
              describe an expansion of RegulonDB, the database containing the
              rich legacy of decades of classic molecular biology experiments
              supporting what we know about gene regulation and operon
              organization in E. coli K-12, to include the genome-wide dataset
              collections from 32 ChIP and 19 gSELEX publications, in addition
              to around 60 genome-wide expression profiles relevant to the
              functional significance of these datasets and used in their
              curation. Three essential features for the integration of this
              information coming from different methodological approaches are:
              first, a controlled vocabulary within an ontology for precisely
              defining growth conditions; second, the criteria to separate
              elements with enough evidence to consider them involved in gene
              regulation from isolated transcription factor binding sites
              without such support; and third, an expanded computational model
              supporting this knowledge. Altogether, this constitutes the basis
              for adequately gathering and enabling the comparisons and
              integration needed to manage and access such wealth of knowledge.
              CONCLUSIONS: This version 10.0 of RegulonDB is a first step
              toward what should become the unifying access point for current
              and future knowledge on gene regulation in E. coli K-12.
              Furthermore, this model platform and associated methodologies and
              criteria can be emulated for gathering knowledge on other
              microbial organisms.",

  abstract = "The reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs)
              is a long-standing challenge in human genetics. Numerous
              computational methods have been developed to infer regulatory
              interactions between human transcriptional factors (TFs) and
              target genes from high-throughput data, and their performance
              evaluation requires gold-standard interactions. Here we present a
              database of literature-curated human TF-target interactions,
              TRRUST (transcriptional regulatory relationships unravelled by
              sentence-based text-mining, http://www.grnpedia.org/trrust),
              which currently contains 8,015 interactions between 748 TF genes
              and 1,975 non-TF genes. A sentence-based text-mining approach was
              employed for efficient manual curation of regulatory interactions
              from approximately 20 million Medline abstracts. To the best of
              our knowledge, TRRUST is the largest publicly available database
              of literature-curated human TF-target interactions to date.
              TRRUST also has several useful features: i) information about the
              mode-of-regulation; ii) tests for target modularity of a query
              TF; iii) tests for TF cooperativity of a query target; iv)
              inferences about cooperating TFs of a query TF; and v)
              prioritizing associated pathways and diseases with a query TF. We
              observed high enrichment of TF-target pairs in TRRUST for
              top-scored interactions inferred from high-throughput data, which
              suggests that TRRUST provides a reliable benchmark for the
              computational reconstruction of human TRNs.",

  abstract = "The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the
              gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a
              widely used approach to characterize the functional status of
              transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data
              sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated
              by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The
              most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2)
              interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico
              prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4)
              reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets.
              However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons
              affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream
              analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and
              biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means
              of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three
              reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of
              TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how
              different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as
              the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction
              with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We
              assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons
              derived from each strategy and better performance by
              literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We
              provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions
              derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a
              resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.",

               Gene expression profile analysis before and after knockdown or

               target genes of TFs and exploring TF functions. Human gene
               expression profile datasets with TF knockdown and knockout are
               accumulating rapidly. Based on the urgent need to
               comprehensively and effectively collect and process these data,
               we developed KnockTF

               human gene expression profile database of TF knockdown and

               expression profile datasets associated with TF knockdown and
               knockout and annotates TFs and their target genes in a
               tissue/cell type-specific manner. The current version of KnockTF

               knockout techniques and across multiple tissue/cell types.
               KnockTF collects upstream pathway information of TFs and
               functional annotation results of downstream target genes. It
               provides details about TFs binding to promoters, super-enhancers
               and typical enhancers of target genes. KnockTF constructs a
               TF-differentially expressed gene network and performs network

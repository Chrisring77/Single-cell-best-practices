              demonstrate that cis-regulatory analysis can be exploited to
              guide the identification of transcription factors and cell
              states. SCENIC provides critical biological insights into the
              mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity.",

  abstract = "Cells require coordinated control over gene expression when
              responding to environmental stimuli. Here we apply scATAC-seq and
              single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in resting and stimulated
              human blood cells. Collectively, we generate ~91,000 single-cell
              profiles, allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory landscape of
              the immunological response across cell types, stimuli, and time.
              Advancing tools to integrate multi-omics data, we develop
              functional inference of gene regulation (FigR), a framework to
              computationally pair scA-TAC-seq with scRNA-seq cells, connect
              distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, and infer
              gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate
              transcription factor (TF) regulators. Utilizing these paired
              multi-omics data, we define domains of regulatory chromatin
              (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter chromatin
              accessibility and gene expression at timescales of minutes.
              Construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at
              disease-associated DORCs. Overall, FigR enables elucidation of
              regulatory interactions across single-cell data, providing new
              opportunities to understand the function of cells within tissues.",

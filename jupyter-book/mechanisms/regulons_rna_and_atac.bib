  abstract  = "Developmental progression is driven by specific spatiotemporal
               domains of gene expression, which give rise to stereotypically
               patterned embryos even in the presence of environmental and
               genetic variation. Views of how transcription factors regulate
               gene expression are changing owing to recent genome-wide studies
               of transcription factor binding and RNA expression. Such studies
               reveal patterns that, at first glance, seem to contrast with the
               robustness of the developmental processes they encode. Here, we
               review our current knowledge of transcription factor function
               from genomic and genetic studies and discuss how different
               strategies, including extensive cooperative regulation (both
               direct and indirect), progressive priming of regulatory
               elements, and the integration of activities from multiple
               enhancers, confer specificity and robustness to transcriptional
               regulation during development.",

  abstract = "Cells require coordinated control over gene expression when
              responding to environmental stimuli. Here we apply scATAC-seq and
              single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in resting and stimulated
              human blood cells. Collectively, we generate ~91,000 single-cell
              profiles, allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory landscape of
              the immunological response across cell types, stimuli, and time.
              Advancing tools to integrate multi-omics data, we develop
              functional inference of gene regulation (FigR), a framework to
              computationally pair scA-TAC-seq with scRNA-seq cells, connect
              distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, and infer
              gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate
              transcription factor (TF) regulators. Utilizing these paired
              multi-omics data, we define domains of regulatory chromatin
              (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter chromatin
              accessibility and gene expression at timescales of minutes.
              Construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at
              disease-associated DORCs. Overall, FigR enables elucidation of
              regulatory interactions across single-cell data, providing new
              opportunities to understand the function of cells within tissues.",
